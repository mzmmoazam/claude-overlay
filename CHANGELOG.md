# Changelog

## [0.2.1] - 2026-04-14

### Fixed
- Claude Code v2+ welcome/login picker appearing after `setup` on fresh machines. Claude Code gates its interactive start on `~/.claude.json` having `hasCompletedOnboarding: true` and `theme` set — these are checked before project env vars are loaded, so the overlay's endpoint/token were never reached. `setup` and `enable` now stamp both keys non-destructively (existing values are preserved; `theme` is only set if the user hasn't already picked one).

### Added
- `doctor` — new first-run-gate check reports `~/.claude.json` state and surfaces a fix hint if either key is missing.
- `engine.py` — new actions `ensure_onboarding` and `check_onboarding`.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-11

### Added
- `doctor` command — validate full setup chain with 10 health checks
- `switch` command — switch active provider without re-running configure
- `export` command — export shareable config (secrets auto-sanitized)
- `import` command — import config from file with merge support
- `setup --dry-run` flag — preview what setup will do without writing files
- Shell completions for bash and zsh
- Multi-provider config support — configure merges instead of overwriting
- Homebrew tap distribution (`brew install mzmmoazam/claude-overlay/claude-overlay`)

### Changed
- `configure` now merges new provider into existing config instead of overwriting
- Overwrite guard changed from blocking prompt to informational display

### Fixed
- Shell injection prevention — file paths passed via sys.argv instead of string interpolation
- `set -e` compatibility — all `py_engine` calls use `|| true` for consistent error handling
